# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata-CSharp
This project is my version of the kata GildedRose in C#. The original version is available here: 
https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

## Getting started
To build and run the project, you will need a Visual Studio IDE, It's working also on a MAC with Mono framework.

## Build and Test
After cloning the project, you can open "GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.sln" file. It will open two folders (projects), one with the GildedRose program and another with the tests.
Before to build the solution, don't forget to restore the NuGet packages by clicking right on the solution project. After that, to run the project, you can click on the play button! Results are showing in the output console.

The tests are developed with NUnit Framework, to run them you have just to click right on the project "GildedRose-Refactoring-KataTests" and run the unit tests.
